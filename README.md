Introduction
A Gym Management System (GMS) is a special type of software created to cater to the needs of a particular fitness center. It aids in the proper maintenance of a member’s records. The application helps associated staff and even owners in keeping track of all members which includes tracking memberships, renewals as well as streamlining operations. In this project, we construct a simple yet effective desktop GUI application using Java Swing.
